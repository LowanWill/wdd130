        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>Think about all of the technology we use in our everyday lives. Do you know anyone who struggles to make
            sense of any of it? Thatâ€™s where I come in. I help users make sense of and use technology to improve their
            lives. I help install hardware and software, give tutorials and teach security principles to individual
            users and businesses who need it most. </p> <!-- change this -->


        <h3>Audience</h3>
        <p>My audience consists of individuals and businesses who have difficulty implementing and using technology.
            They either don't know where to start or how to use the technology they already have. They may not
            understand security principles and may need help securing their technology and training on preventative
            measures. </p> <!-- change this -->
