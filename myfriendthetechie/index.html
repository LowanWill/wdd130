                <h2>How We Can Help</h2>
                <p>My Friend the Techie is a service to help you make the most of technology for personal use or for your
                    business. Whether you don't know where to start or have questions and need training for what you already
                    have, we can help you leverage technology to make your life easier. We can assess the technology you
                    currently have and help train you how to use it more effectively. We can also recommend new technology for
                    your particular needs. We find out what you would like to accomplish and tailor our services to your
                    specific needs.
                    We can help you with installing hardware and software. We can provide training on how to use both the
                    hardware and software you use so you can get the most benefit from it. We can help you with securing your
                    technology as well. We provide training on using preventative measures along with training on what to do
                    when you have a breach in security. </p>
