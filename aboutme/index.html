    <p>I am an online student working toward an Applied Technology Degree.  I am currently working on my Computer Programming Certificate, and I love it!</p>
    <p>I have been married to my sweetheart for 3 and a half years.  We have 6 children between us and 8 grandchildren. We live in the Pittsburgh, PA area and have goals to move back to warmer climates.  We moved here about a year and a half ago from the gulf coast of Alabama and we miss the beach!</p>
    <p>I work full time as a legal assistant.  I love to cook and bake and I am currently learning how to play the ukulele.  I have been a member of the church since I was 19. I cant imaging what my life would be without the gospel in it.</p>
